    def expectimax(board, dice_roll, depth, is_maximizing_player, is_chance_node,players):
        """
        Implements the Expectimax algorithm

        Parameters:
        ----------
        board : Board
            The current state of the game represented as a Board object.
        dice_roll : int
            The result of the dice roll for the current turn (1-6).
        depth : int
            The depth of the search tree. When depth reaches 0, the algorithm evaluates the board.
        is_maximizing_player : bool
            True if the current player is the maximizing player; False otherwise.
        is_chance_node : bool
            True if the current node represents a chance event (e.g., rolling a dice).
        players : list
            A list of players in the game, typically containing identifiers for each player (e.g., 'Blue' and 'Red').

        Returns:
        -------
        tuple
            A tuple containing:
            - float: The evaluated score of the board state based on the game's evaluation function.
            - Board or None: The best move as a Board object for the current player, or None if the node is a chance node.

        Notes:
        -----
        - If the depth reaches 0 or there is a terminal state (a winner is determined), the method returns the evaluated score.
        - The algorithm distinguishes between three types of nodes:
            1. Chance nodes: Evaluate the expected value based on possible dice rolls.
            2. Maximizing nodes: The AI chooses the best move to maximize the score.
            3. Minimizing nodes: The opponent chooses the move to minimize the score.

        Example:
        --------
        result, best_move = AI.expectimax(current_board, 4, 3, True, False, ['Blue', 'Red'])
